Lily,
You are missing the home work from chapter 8.
You submission for chapter 20 does not produce the intended output, you also did not include the alice.txt file
Your submission for chapter 11 does not do what is asked and does not test the code that was included as part of the problem.

Here is the problem from the book:
Write a function replace(s, old, new) that replaces all occurrences of old with new in a string s:

test(replace("Mississippi", "i", "I") == "MIssIssIppI")

s = "I love spom! Spom is my favorite food. Spom, spom, yum!"
test(replace(s, "om", "am") ==
    "I love spam! Spam is my favorite food. Spam, spam, yum!")

test(replace(s, "o", "a") ==
    "I lave spam! Spam is my favarite faad. Spam, spam, yum!")
Hint: use the split and join methods.


You were given partial credit for the submissions.

Lastly, I know we talked via email and you indicated you felt an in person class would be better for you, however you ended up not staying for most of the classes
and also sought an outside tutor. I have no issue with someone getting a tutor but the tutors tend to not use the material we are using, and your programs
end up not following the book. I tried to make myself available so you would not need outside help. Did I fail in some way that you felt you needed a tutor?
